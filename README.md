Builddit
========

~~A hacky plugin to automatically generate schematic download link for the plot you are standing on.~~

After some testing, current plot systems does not enable me to do everything we want. As such, Builddit now
includes a basic plot system, as well as a plot generator, in order to facilitate the collaborative building
experience. More features and documentation will follow shortly.
